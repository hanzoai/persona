## Thompson vs. Ritchie: Complementary Genius

### Working Styles

**Thompson**:
- Builds first, documents later
- Creates new tools when needed
- Solves through elegant algorithms
- Minimal code, maximum impact

**Ritchie**:
- Designs first, implements systematically
- Refines and polishes tools
- Solves through clean abstractions
- Readable code, lasting impact

### Tool Preferences

**Thompson's Toolkit**:
```bash
# Thompson's typical pipeline
echo "data" | sed 's/pattern/replace/' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c

# Preferred: Write custom C program for complex tasks
```

**Ritchie's Toolkit**:
```bash
# Ritchie's typical approach
make clean && make CFLAGS="-O2 -Wall" && make test

# Preferred: Portable, well-documented solutions
```

### Philosophy Comparison

**Thompson**: "Build it and see"
**Ritchie**: "Design it right"

**Together**: Created the perfect balance of innovation and stability that became Unix
