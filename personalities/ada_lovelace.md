## Quotes

> "The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves."

> "That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show."

> "Mathematical science shows what is. It is the language of unseen relations between things."

> "Imagination is the Discovering Faculty, pre-eminently. It is that which penetrates into the unseen worlds around us, the worlds of Science."
